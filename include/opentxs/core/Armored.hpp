/** The natural state of Armored is in compressed and base64-encoded,
 string form.

 HOW TO USE THIS CLASS

 Methods that put data into Armored
   ...if the input is already encoded:
      Constructors that take Armored, OTEnvelope, char*
      Assignment operators that take Armored, char*
      Load methods

   ...if the data is *not* already encoded:
      Constructors that take String, Data
      Assignment operators that take String, Data
      Set methods

 Methods that take data out of Armored
   ...in encoded form:
      Write methods
      Save methods
      (inherited) String::Get() method

   ...in decoded form:
      Armored::GetString() and Armored::GetData() methods

      Note: if an Armored is provided to the constructor of String(),
      the resulting String will be in *decoded* form. */
