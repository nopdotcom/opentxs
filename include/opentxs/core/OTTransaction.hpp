/*
WHEN THE server receives a transaction request, it receives a MESSAGE containing
an ascii-armored LEDGER.

 The TYPE of the message might be "process inbox" or "process these transfers".
 but either way there is a ledger bundled that contains a list of transactions
(often a list of one.)

 a ledger is stored as my inbox

 a ledger is sent in a message to send me my inbox

 a ledger is what I send the server when I ask it to process a couple of
transactions.
 Each one of them has a transaction number.
 Therefore the ledger must have a MAP of transactions, indexed by TRANSACTION
NUMBER.

 Therefore message cannot handle transaction number.

 Perhaps ledger is derived from message.  CMD3 is a ledger in an envelope.
 Then it can do everything that a message can do,




 A message contains a payload of a ledger

 the ledger contains a list of transactions

Ledger is derived from contract because you must be able to save / sign it and
load from string,
 and because it must have items in it.


 transactions are derived from messages. a transaction is a form of message.
 (technically you could do a CMD3 and just send a transaction but the above is
cleaner.)

 Messages already have server ID, command, Account ID,

 No a transaction is just a sibling to a message. It's it's own thing derived
from contract.
  but they have similarities

 so a ledger has a list of transactions. BOTH are derived from contract.

 A transaction has a list of Items. a transaction can also be "in reference to"
an item.

 does an item need to be a contract?

 each item has to be individually signed (because when I accept Sue's spend,
that signed accepted item goes back to Sue.)

 So the item has to be a contract. Each is signed and then put on the
transaction's list of items.

 Each transaction is also signed and includes a transaction number and is on the
ledger's list of transactions.

 The ledger itself is signed because it may be saved into a file.

 The whole enchilada is wrapped up in ascii-armor and attached to a message and
sent over the pipe.

/*

 Partially loading transactions!  (New development, born out of necessity.)

 A few volunteers have played with OT test servers, and we (unsurprisingly)
started noticing messaging
 delays where a user had accumulated a thousand receipts in his inbox, and when
he tried to download it
 he would miss the message, and thus get out of sync. He can't download his
inbox anymore.

 So now, the inbox is not going to contain a copy of the actual receipts
themselves, as normally with
 transactions inside a ledger. Instead, the receipts will be saved into a
separate location, and they
 will be given a "save to ledger" function that will save the full thing (for
message ledgers) or a partial
 version (for inbox/outbox/nymbox ledgers) with no attachments (MUCH smaller
size) and which contains a hash
 of the actual full receipt.

 OT should just be able to ASSUME that the client software has downloaded the
relevant receipts (a message
 will be added to the protocol for downloading these receipts.) The transaction
object on an inbox will have
 a flag set to false until the actual receipt has been loaded (not just the
inbox placeholder) and certain
 actions will simply fail if that flag has not been set to true from the ACTUAL
full receipt being loaded.
 Or the function will automatically try to load said receipt, and then fail if
that action fails. If the receipt
 hash appears in the inbox, therefore the API should be able to assume that the
receipt itself is available for
 inspection.

 Todo:
 -- "Save To Abbreviated form" function.

 And what does it save?
 transactionType        m_Type;        // blank, pending, processInbox,
transfer, deposit, withdrawal, trade, etc.
 time64_t                    m_DATE_SIGNED;        // The date, in seconds, when
the instrument was last signed.
 std::int64_t                    m_lTransactionNum;    // The server issues this
and
it must be sent with transaction request.
 std::int64_t                    m_lInReferenceToTransaction;
 std::int64_t                    m_lClosingTransactionNo; // used by
finalReceipt
 also:                AMOUNT.  // GetReceiptAmount()
 std::int64_t                m_lAbbrevAmount; // Stored here after loading, but
not
saved from here in the first place (see GetReceiptAmount())
 std::int64_t                m_lDisplayAmount; // Just like m_lAbbrevAmount,
except
it stores the display amount. For example, a transferReceipt for a 5000 clam
transfer has an effective value of 0 (since the transfer is already done) but it
has a display amount of 5000.
 OTIdentifier        m_Hash;             // Created while saving abbreviated
record, loaded back with it, then verified against actual hash when loading
actual box receipt.

 DOES NOT SAVE:
 listOfItems    m_listItems;        // the various items in this transaction.
 Armored   m_ascCancellationRequest; // used by finalReceipt
//    OTIdentifier    m_ID;            // Account ID. This is in Contract
(parent class). Here we use it for the REAL ACCOUNT ID (set before loading.)
 OTIdentifier    m_AcctID;        // Compare m_AcctID to m_ID after loading it
from string or file. They should match, and signature should verify.
 OTIdentifier    m_NotaryID;        // Notary ID as used to instantiate the
transaction, based on expected NotaryID.
 OTIdentifier    m_AcctNotaryID;    // Actual NotaryID within the signed
portion. (Compare to m_NotaryID upon loading.)
 OTIdentifier    m_AcctNymID;        // NymID of the user who created this
item. (In the future, this item
 Armored    m_ascInReferenceTo;    // This item may be in reference to a
different item

 Normally we only save the "purported" values. But in "save to ledger" function
I only want to save the values
 that I'm EXPECTING to be in those receipts, not the values that are ACTUALLY in
those receipts. (Of course they
 ARE the values that were in the receipts when first saved, but I don't know
what will be in the receipts when I LOAD
 them again, until I load them and verify that they are still the right ones.
Perhaps a substitution occured in the meantime.

 In any case, when I am making the abbreviated record, I already know that
information from the ledger itself
 (user ID, account ID, server ID, etc) so I don't bother storing it for each
transaction at all since it's already
 stored for the ledger as a whole. I can set the expected numbers based on that,
and then verify it against the purported
 numbers when the ACTUAL receipt is loaded up.

 Hmm ProduceOutboxReportItem() and ProduceInboxReportItem() ALREADY do the work
of grabbing the Type, transaction#,
 the reference #, the closing #, and the amount. Therefore I'll use that to do
the work, and then iterate the balance
 item's sub-items when saving in abbreviated form. But this means I have to
store the hash in the sub-items (at the time
 of their creation) which means I probably want to just keep it there for the
normal balance agreements as well. But
 for normal balance agreements, the sub-items are stored on an actual item, so
I'll check out that code... maybe just save
 that item itself directly in the ledger... except the balance portions aren't
appropriate, only the sub-item portions.
 CHANGE OF HEART:  I won't be using the sub-items for this, the difference is
great enough that I'd be forcing a square
 peg into a round hole. Just adding a few functions for saving/loading in
abbreviated form.


 NEED TO CODE:
 -- Server message for downloading "box receipts."

 -- Method on OTTransaction for saving in abbreviated format to a string. Called
by...

 -- Fix OTLedger Load/Save so it only loads/saves transactions in abbreviated
format, which should only be
    useful for getting enough information in order to download the receipts.
From there, the existing "verify"
    function should try to load them all before actually verifying. (From there,
you have loaded and verified the transaction,
    which we normally do anyway before using it, so now that's all done, so we
can go ahead and use it as normal.)

 -- How does user get his box receipts? downloads from server and loads during
verify process.

 -- How does Ledger save? It calls OTTransaction::SaveToAbbreviatedForm() or
some such, in a loop, and saves all their
    vitals.

 -- How about the transactions themselves (the full "box receipts" and not just
abbreviated versions) ?
    1. User never saves them other than when downloading from server, and he
must compare them against the hash in the box.
    2. User loads them as part of verify process when verifying
inbox/outbox/nymbox.
    3. Server must First Save them at the same time that they are added to the
box itself.
    4. From there server can load anytime also, similar to user (verify
process.) Server should never fail since it CREATED the receipt.

 -- Server is safe to erase the box receipt at the same time that it's been
removed from its box. In practice this
    should be handled by saving the box receipt with a MARKED FOR DELETION flag
added.

 -- WHERE to save? (client and server side)

 Keeping in mind there are also "cron receipts" (OTCronItem is for recurring
transactions like market offers/trades,
 and smart contracts) as well as "transaction receipts" (*every* server reply to
every transaction request is automatically
 saved, success or fail, as a transaction receipt.) They are stored like so:

 ~/.ot/client_data/receipts/tmHvLZxb13hW6OyH1oHKTmKd7fTMRsUfzqPE6KCwSjl
 > ls
 1mxwHcQvxSgqWqy2e28ZREeuVVfgs0kxE41FN10TnS3.success

gys4puOdx15pknQYcVtF4DmOo2tOYouoiqcQAHKApSF.success
w06QIURsSDV7sdWWvyPSxRaiv4T2MUQbJyWmIKxSmuL.success

 basically:
 OT_DATA/receipts/NOTARY_ID/ACCT_ID.success
 OT_DATA/receipts/NOTARY_ID/ACCT_ID.fail

 or:
 OT_DATA/receipts/NOTARY_ID/NYM_ID.success
 OT_DATA/receipts/NOTARY_ID/NYM_ID.fail

 These receipts are related to balance agreement. These are the "last signed
receipt" that you keep in order to
 verify later against future intermediary files, to make sure the server isn't
screwing you with bad intermediary
 files. Sometimes there is a transaction statement, and sometimes there is a
balance agreement (depending on whether
 both sides are merely agreeing on the list of signed-out transaction numbers,
or whether they are additionally
 agreement on the balance and inbox items for a specific asset account as well.)

 (The transaction statements are the ones stored by NYM_ID, and the balance
agreements are the ones by ACCT_ID.)

 -----------

 In addition to "cron receipts" and "transaction receipts", I am now adding this
idea of "box receipts" which is really
 just your inbox items stored in a separate file, because they simply won't all
fit comfortably in a getInbox message.
 How to store them?

 Current inbox/outbox path:    OT_DATA/[inbox|outbox]/NOTARY_ID/ACCT_ID
 Current nymbox path:        OT_DATA/nymbox/NOTARY_ID/NYM_ID

 Therefore I propose the box receipts to be stored:

 Inbox/outbox path:    OT_DATA/inbox/NOTARY_ID/ACCT_ID.r/TRANSACTION_ID.rct
 nymbox path:        OT_DATA/nymbox/NOTARY_ID/NYM_ID.r/TRANSACTION_ID.rct

 When querying the server for a box receipt, you will have to provide TYPE
(inbox, outbox, etc)
 as well as ID (acct ID or Nym ID, depending on which box type) as well as
transaction number,
 and the hash.

 ------------

 Note: When loading from string, IF IN ABBREVIATED FORM, then we must take care
to verify the
 loaded values against their expected counterparts, before OVERWRITING the
"expected" values
 with the actual ones from the box receipts. Rather than store each value
separately, (as we did
 with notaryID, acctID, etc in OTTransactionType) we will instead simply take
care to verify them
 during loading, if the "abbreviated" flag is set.

 ------------

 THE BEST TIME to actually SAVE the box receipt, on the Server Side, is at the
same time that it is first being
 added to the relevant box itself. (Look into centralizing that mechanism...)

    // cases where the user sends through a transaction that is MEANT to be
    // rejected by the server, for the purpose of cancelling that transaction.
    // For example, if I sent a smart contract on to the next party, and then
    // later I decided to cancel it (before the next party had the chance to
    // activate it.) I send through the (incomplete) contract AS THOUGH to
    // activate it, specifically so the activation will fail (and thus cancel
    // the smart contract.) This prevents anyone from activating it in the
    // future (thus, it's now "cancelled.")
    //
    // In these cases, when I am "cancelling" something, a successful
    // cancellation
    // will result in a "rejected" reply from the server. A notice of this is
    // sent to all the parties as well. The rejection notice causes all the
    // parties to properly harvest their transaction numbers as they normally
    // would when a smart contract fails activation. (Thus, a successful
    // cancellation.)
    //
    // But how do we know the difference between a normal "rejection" versus
    // a "rejection" that corresponds to a successful cancellation? That's
    // what m_bCancelled is for. If the server has just successfully cancelled
    // something, it will set m_bCancelled to TRUE (on the reply transaction.)
    // This way the client side can tell the difference between an actual
    // failed attempt marked as "rejected", versus a successful cancellation
    // marked as "rejected." All the client has to do is check m_bCancelled
    // to see if it's set to TRUE, and it will know.
