        // Perhaps also, on the server side, send a list of request
        // numbers for that Nym that the server KNOWS the Nym saw
        // the reply to. This way, the Nym can remove the number
        // from his list, and thus won't be continually causing the
        // server to load up the Nymbox and try to remove the
        // replyNotice (since it's already been removed.)
        // // //
        // The Nym doesn't have to keep a list of ALL request
        // numbers he's seen the reply to. Rather, just the past X
        // number of them, and with the number explicitly removed
        // once he sees the server acknowledgment.
        // (ServerAckOfAlreadyGotReply.)
        // // //
        // The server, meanwhile, is free to remove the ACK for any
        // request # once he sees that the client has as well.
        // Server also only needs to store a list of the past X
        // request #s. Also: since both sides REMOVE the number,
        // there need not necessarily be a limit on the size of the
        // list, since it grows and shrinks as needed.
        // // //
        // Whenever Wallet processes a server reply, just see if
        // it's on that "replied to already" list already on client
        // side. If so, discard the reply.
        // OTClient::ProcessServerReply probably best place to do
        // (We replied to it already, so discard it.) Also, for any
        // server reply, look at the list of numbers on it. The
        // server is acknowledging to us that it KNOWS we got those
        // replies, and that it ALREADY has removed them from the
        // Nymbox as a result. Therefore we can remove ALL of those
        // numbers from our own list as well. No need for an API
        // call to do this, since it will happen internally to OT.
        // // //
        // On the server side, any numbers on its own list were only
        // there to acknowledge numbers that had been on the client
        // side list. Therefore, when those numbers disappear from
        // the client side list, the server simply removes them.
        // Again: ANY NUMBERS on the server list, which do NOT
        // appear on the client list, are REMOVED From the server
        // list. After all, the client has clearly now removed them,
        // so the server doesn't have to keep them around either.
        // // //
        // These are useful for synchronization but also there's a
        // std::int64_t term benefit, if we include them in the
        // signed receipt (which they will be already, if the
        // receipt contains the entire message and not just the
        // transaction.) That benefit is that we can prove receipt
        // of notice. At least, notice of server replies. But for
        // other notice types, such as notice of upcoming meeting.
        // Or notice of upcoming election. Or notice of election
        // outcome. Or notice of petition to put X issue on the next
        // ballot, or to nominate Y Nym for some corporate role.
        // Sometimes you want to be able to PROVE that notice was
        // received. Does this prove that? Hmm, not necessarily.
        // Currently I'm using this as an optimization scheme, which
        // is useful even if not provable. How to make it provable?
        // // //
        // Back from tangent: Wait a sec! If I notice the server
        // that I saw the reply, the server will remove that reply
        // from my Nymbox -- but it's still in my Nymbox on the
        // client side! Until I download the latest Nymbox. Thus if
        // I try to PROCESS MY NYMBOX, I will be attempting to
        // accept a receipt that's already gone! (And the

        // bother downloading any replyNotice Box Receipts if their request
        // number appears on that
        // list. Again: the list means I DEFINITELY already responded to it--if
        // the request # is on
        // that list, then NO NEED downloading the Box Receipt -- I DEFINITELY
        // already got that reply!
        //
        // Therefore, Something like SwigWrap::HaveAlreadySeenReply(notaryID,
        // nymID, requestNum);
        //
        // Perhaps also, on the server side, send a list of request numbers for
        // that Nym that the
        // server KNOWS the Nym saw the reply to. This way, the Nym can remove
        // the number from his
        // list, and thus won't be continually causing the server to load up the
        // Nymbox and try
        // to remove the replyNotice (since it's already been removed.)
        //
        // The Nym doesn't have to keep a list of ALL request numbers he's seen
        // the reply to.
        // Rather, just the past X number of them, and with the number
        // explicitly removed once
        // he sees the server acknowledgment. (ServerAckOfAlreadyGotReply.)
        //
        // The server, meanwhile, is free to remove the ACK for any request #
        // once he sees that
        // the client has as well. Server also only needs to store a list of the
        // past X request #s.
        // Also: since both sides REMOVE the number, there need not necessarily
        // be a limit on the
        // size of the list, since it grows and shrinks as needed.
        //
        // Whenever Wallet processes a server reply, just see if it's on that
        // "replied to already"
        // list already on client side. If so, discard the reply.
        // OTClient::ProcessServerReply probably
        // best place to do  (We replied to it already, so discard it.)
        // Also, for any server reply, look at the list of numbers on it. The
        // server is acknowledging
        // to us that it KNOWS we got those replies, and that it ALREADY has
        // removed them from the
        // Nymbox as a result. Therefore we can remove ALL of those numbers from
        // our own list
        // as well. No need for an API call to do this, since it will happen
        // internally to OT.
        //
        // On the server side, any numbers on its own list were only there to
        // acknowledge numbers
        // that had been on the client side list. Therefore, when those numbers
        // disappear from the
        // client side list, the server simply removes them. Again: ANY NUMBERS
        // on the server list,
        // which do NOT appear on the client list, are REMOVED From the server
        // list. After all, the
        // client has clearly now removed them, so the server doesn't have to
        // keep them around either.
        //
        // These are useful for synchronization but also there's a std::int64_t
        // term
        // benefit, if we include
        // them in the signed receipt (which they will be already, if the
        // receipt contains the entire
        // message and not just the transaction.) That benefit is that we can
        // prove receipt of notice.
        // At least, notice of server replies. But for other notice types, such
        // as notice of upcoming
        // meeting. Or notice of upcoming election. Or notice of election
        // outcome. Or notice of petition
        // to put X issue on the next ballot, or to nominate Y Nym for some
        // corporate role. Sometimes
        // you want to be able to PROVE that notice was received. Does this
        // prove that?
        // Hmm, not necessarily. Currently I'm using this as an optimization
        // scheme, which is useful
        // even if not provable. How to make it provable?
        //
        // Back from tangent: Wait a sec! If I notice the server that I saw the
        // reply, the server will
        // remove that reply from my Nymbox -- but it's still in my Nymbox on
        // the client side! Until
        // I download the latest Nymbox. Thus if I try to PROCESS MY NYMBOX, I
        // will be attempting to
        // accept a receipt that's already gone! (And the processNymbox will
        // therefore FAIL!)
        // Solution: be smart enough, when processing Nymbox, to IGNORE any
        // replyNotices when the request
        // Number appears on the client's list! As the wallet processes the
        // Nymbox it should already
        // know to skip the ones that were already replied-to.
        // Meanwhile the server side will deliberately NOT update the Nymbox
        // hash just because the receipt
        // was removed. Otherwise it could trigger an unnecessary download of
        // the Nymbox, when the whole
        // point of this exercise was to prevent unnecessary downloads. It only
        // updates the Nymbox hash
        // when it WANTS me to download the Nymbox, and that certainly does NOT
        // apply to cases where the
        // only change involved the removal of some old receipt I already
