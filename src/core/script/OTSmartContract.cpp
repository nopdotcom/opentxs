// OTSmartContract is derived from OTCronItem.
//
// WHAT DOES IT DO?
//
// 1) The clauses and bylaws can be written in script language by
//    the users, without having to change OT itself. SCRIPTABLE CLAUSES!
//    Invent your own financial instruments and processes, involving
//    multiple agents and asset accounts.
// 2) Any number of parties can sign these contracts.
// 3) Each Party has a name, and can be referred to using that name
//    from within the script code. Parties can also bring accounts and
//    other assets into these agreements, and scripts can manipulate them.
// 4) A party to an agreement can be an individual nym, OR it can be a
//    fictional ENTITY formed by some prior agreement.
// 5) A party may have many agents. Since some parties are fictional
//    entities (e.g. a corporation, a democracy, an estate for a deceased
//    person, etc), parties are able to appoint agents to act on their
//    behalf. An individual Nym is really just an individual Party who
//    acts as his own agent, whereas a corporation is owned by a voting group,
//    and appoints a Nym to act as its agent. Voting groups will soon also be
//    able to act as agents IN SOME RESPECTS. (Voting groups are coming
//    next, after smart contracts.) These will be able to edit bylaws, etc.
// 6) A Smart Contract has a list of parties, each with a list of agents.
//    Parties also bring asset accounts to the agreement, for use in the
// scripts.
// 7) A Smart Contract also has a list of bylaws, each with a list of clauses.
//    Each set of Bylaws also has its own variables, which can be used by the
//    scripts.
// 8) A Smart Contract can be activated (provided all parties have properly
//    signed), and it can process repeatedly over time until it expires or gets
//    deactivated. While it's active, parties can trigger specific clauses and
//    the smart contract will also occasionally trigger AUTOMATICALLY (depending
//    on how it has been configured.)
// 9) Users can decide which functions will activate--and when--and which
//    powers will be vested in the various parties and agents.
// 10) HOOKS -- Scripts trigger upon various EVENTS such as onActivate,
//    onDeactivate, onTrigger, etc. Perhaps a timer is set causing the custom
//    function "TransferEmergencyFunds" to trigger in 24 hours, or 30 days,
//    or when the price of gold reaches X... or however you code the scripted
//    clauses in your contract...
//
// The design makes it easy to swap in different script languages. (Currently
// for experimental purposes I am using chaiscript.)
//

/*
 RUNNING LIST of standard hooks, functions, constants, variables, etc..

 - I'm thinking that Constants and Variables should be available in OTBylaw AND
OTScriptable.
 - Ah maybe just have them in Bylaws only, and then have a "library" Bylaw that
is "global" to the OTScriptable.

 - OT Internal Functions will be available on server side inside scripts, just
like OT API is
   on client side. They're written in C++.
 - Callbacks are the opposite: they're written in script, and available for the
C++ to call when it needs to.
 - Script Functions can be called by all parties, unless CanTriggerClause(name,
party) returns false.
 - Hooks should be stored as a list on the Bylaws. If hook "OnActivate" is
triggered, then I ask each Bylaw to
   run any relevant scripts for that hook.


 VARIABLES  (These are changed values you can store inside your smart contract,
which stay persistent between runs.)

 -- The first one of these will probably be a timer variable, used with
OnProcess() to trigger some
    timed clause.  You'll set it to 100, then decrement every call, then trigger
when it hits zero.
    (Or trigger every time X person withdraws money, etc.)

 -- Let's say a contract processes 100 times but only does something important
the last time. Do I REALLY
    need a receipt for every fucking 100 times just because some timer variable
changed? Therefore, probably
    want to strictly define two types of variables:  Those that require a
receipt when they change, and those
    that do not.  Therefore:

 TYPES:   Constant (cannot change), Persistent (stores over time; change doesn't
require noticing the parties),
          Important (Stores over time; change requires notice to the parties).

 Any notice should be accompanied by a notice # so parties can see if they
missed a notice.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------


 CONSTANTS   (These are standard values available inside any script.)

 -- ProcessInterval. (The contract will activate every X seconds. Default 30.)

 NOTE:  I probably won't let users change this, but rather, will let them
 use a multiple of it.  Or maybe I'll let them have fine-tuned timing, but just
 charge them for it via server fees.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CALLBACKS   (OT will call these scripts when it needs an answer to something.)

 -- CanDeactivate(Party). Script returns true/false whether Party is allowed to
deactivate the contract.
    Anyone party to the contract can cancel it, by default. (You can change that
with this callback.)

    can_execute_clause(party_name, clause_name)

 -- CanTriggerClause(Party, Clause).  Script returns whether Party is allowed to
call this clause. Default true.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 OT INTERNAL FUNCTIONS   (Calls into OT that you can make from inside your
scripts.)

 -- These are like the OT API calls, except on the server side. Examples?

 -- ExecuteClause(Bylaw, Clause)
 -- ExecuteClause(Clause)

    These allow you to, from inside a clause, execute any other clause on the
same contract.

 -- FlagForRemoval()    This removes the script from Cron. Deactivates it.

 -- Imagine OTParty->SendMessage(OtherParty). CANNOT DO THIS. Why not? Because
on the client side, the sender
    can actually sign the thing before sending it. But on the server side, the
server cannot sign with someone's
    nym since it doesn't have that private key. It CAN verify contracts, and
transfer money, check balances, etc.

 -- Definitely a call that transfers money from one Party's account to another,
dropping a receipt.

 -- Calls that withdraw money and return a financial instrument. For example:
"Take 100 clams out of Jim's acct,
    issue a server cheque for 100 clams, and send it to George."  You might ask,
why not just have the cheque come
    from Jim directly?  Answer: Because the server can't forge Jim's signature.
Instead, the server justifies the
    action to Jim by providing a copy of the script contract in his inbox
receipt when it takes the money. It signs
    its own cheque, which is something it actually can do, and it sends it to
George. A copy is sent to all parties
    so they can prove later on whether the voucher was redeemed. But they can't
redeem it themselves, since it is
    made out to George.

 -- Interesting: Certain instruments REQUIRE the client side! The server can't
withdraw cash on your behalf since
    it can't generate the prototokens, nor can it unblind them. The server can't
write a cheque on your behalf since
    it can't forge your signature.  It CAN withdraw cash on its own, and send to
whoever you want, but then you have
    to trust the server not trace that cash (it's traceable in that case.) It
CAN write a cheque on your behalf, but
    of course you have to trust the server that the money will be there when
that cheque is cashed.  It CANNOT create
    a market order on your behalf! You have to sign that when you do it.  It
CANNOT activate some new smart contract
    on your behalf, since it can't forge your signature. It CANNOT initiate a
transfer (since you must sign.) Instead
    it just moves the funds and leaves you a copy of the script as your receipt.
(You DID sign the script, so it IS
    a good enough receipt for that.)  I suppose that it CAN exchange you in/out
of a basket, although normally you'd
    expect a receipt showing your request. I guess future versions of OT can be
smart enough to interpret a basket
    receipt in different ways, depending on whether the InRefTo contains an
exchange request or a smart contract.

 -- A call that ADDS a script to a hook. Imagine there 100 different hooks: you
don't actually have scripts for
    all of them!!! But perhaps you have a certain script, that gets ATTACHED to
a hook at some point, based on
    script logic, and then THEREAFTER activates on that hook when it previously
didn't. Therefore even OnActivate()
    and OnDeactivate() should have their own actual script names, and then those
scripts are attached to the hooks
    known as OnActivate and OnDeactivate().  The portion of the smart contract
that attaches them changes over time,
    as this call is made, adding them and removing them.
    It could be that ONE script is registered to a hook, and then some event
causes it to be de-registered
    and then another one is registered to take its place!

 -- Functions to send notices to various parties and inboxes. (The server can't
forge a party's message to
    another, but it CAN send them all a message from the server itself.)
Therefore NOTICES.

 -- Anytime funds are moved between accounts, they should get a scriptReceipt
aka paymentReceipt type deal.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SCRIPT FUNCTIONS   (Scripts you add to your smart contract, which can be
triggered by parties.)

 -- First one will probably be "DisputeEscrow()" for the escrow contract.

 -- Might be nice to have clauses that are available for others to call.
    Perhaps a "library" Bylaw that other bylaws have access to.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HOOKS       (Scripts you add to your smart contract, which will trigger
automatically upon specific events.)

 -- OnActivate()        This happens when script is first activated.
 -- OnDeactivate()        This happens when script is deactivated.
 -- OnProcess()            This happens every ProcessInterval.
 -- OnExpire()            Happens when the script is deactivated due to reaching
end of valid date/time range.



 OTHER HOOKS?


 Bylaws need to have a list of hooks, where the hook name corresponds to the
clause name.
 Just as they have a list of clauses, they also need a list of the hooks those
clauses are triggered by.






 Still need todo on smart contracts:

 -- Serialization
 -- Confirmation
 -- Verification
 -- Native Functions such as:

    move_funds(from_acct, to_acct)                (from_acct and to_acct must be
a party to the agreement)
    send_cashiers_cheque(from_acct, to_nym)        (from_acct must be a party to
the agreement. to_nym doesn't have to be.)
    stash_funds(from_acct, "stash_one", 100)    ("stash_one" is stored inside
the bylaw. Server-side only.)
    unstash_funds("stash_one", to_acct, 100)    (Smartcontract must be activated
with no stashes. Server creates/maintains them.)
    unstash_funds_to_nym("stash_one", to_nym, 100)    (This is like
send_cashiers_cheque, except from a stash.)
    get_balance(acct)                            (acct must be party to
agreement.)

    send_notice(to_nym)                            (Like sendMessage, except it
comes from the server, not another user.)
    send_notice_to_parties()                    (Does a send_notice to ALL
parties.)

    can_execute_clause(party_name, clause_name) (See if a party is allowed to
execute any given clause.)


 -- Dirtiness:
    Important variables changed require a Nymbox notice sent. (agreementReceipt)
    Any movement of funds requires Inbox notice sent to relevant parties. (can I
just use paymentReceipt? Otherwise agreementReceipt here too.)
    FinalReceipt requires Nymbox AND Inbox notices to be sent.  (finalReceipt.)

 -- Client command to message server and activate a new SmartContract.
 -- Server functions to process said message, and activate the script on cron.

 -- (Postponed) Make a new OTScriptable-derived class called OTTitle (which
represents a registered piece of property)
    and add client commands / server functions for functionality like
SmartContract, except you are registering an
    OTTitle for a static piece of property, versus activating an OTCronItem that
processes and triggers repeatedly
    over time. OTTitle will probably derive from Contract, in the same way
that OTUnitDefinition derives from
    Contract. You will be able to register title on a server similar to
registering an asset contract. Except,
    instead of getting an issuer acct, you get a deed...

 -- (Postponed) There are several ways to own title to property. One is to have
an OTDeed class, which allows any specific Nym to
    have a title registered to him based on a specific transaction #, which is
released whenever the deed is transferred.
    This enables destruction-of-acct-history similar to unit-based accounts, but
it also necessitates the use of an "asset
    account" (with an inbox) specifically for holding deed-based property. (This
is necessary in order to prove ownership
    and everything else--the same as with unit-based accounts.)  I probably will
NOT code this "deed" piece anytime soon...

 -- (Upcoming) ...HOWEVER, ANOTHER WAY to own title (WITHOUT A DEED) is through
SHAREHOLDING. That is where my interest currently
    lies. Therefore I will add the OTEntity class. Instead of being derived from
Contract like OTTitle, it will be derived from
    OTScriptable (similar to the smart contracts.)  This will enable it to have
parties and bylaws.
    Similar to cron items, which save the original copy but also save updated
copies whenever something changes, I will cause
    OTEntity to generate a unique ID based on the entity as it originally
appeared when first registered. The original version
    is always retrievable by a shareholder and hashing it should produce the
actual entity ID.
    But from there, the Entity can evolve over time. Since it is
OTScriptable-derived, it can have parties, and bylaws. The
    parties can take actions to change the bylaws and appointments.
    The political structure of the entity is determined by the parties. There
might be 3 parties who are all Nyms, in which case
    you have a partnership. If the entity's charter says, "Party A is a Nym:
FellowTraveler", and if all parties by default have
    the power to alter the bylaws, appoint employees, activate clauses to move
funds, etc, then you now have an individual
    controlling the entity.
    WHERE THIS IS GOING: A party whose agent is a voting group, whose members
are determined by shareholdership in STOCK of
    the entity. (Really could be configured to stock in any stock ID, but people
will WANT the stock to be in the entity.) Future
    versions of OT will allow creation of multiple classes of stock, and indeed
there is nothing stopping entities now from
    issuing whatever currencies they want, with the issuer accounts controlled
by them or their agents. Of course it's better
    to have it strict in the bylaws, and have OT just execute it that way, and
for now that's how it will be with the DEFAULT,
    HARDCODED current path of a SINGLE class of stock for each entity, with the
Entity's ID serving as the Instrument Definition ID. I think
    it would be a LONG TIME before we ever need more functionality than that
anyway, so that's what I'll focus on.

 -- So I need OTVotingGroup class which will determine members based on various
types of groups.
    1) Shareholders. Expects a weighted vote among shareholders based on asset
type ID matching entity ID.
    2) Appointed members. A list of members (NymIDs) is explicitly stored in
this group. (Like the list of board members.)

    (1) Will take advantage of existing asset account code (for weighted
voting),
    and (2) will take advantage of existing digital cash code (for secret
ballots.)

    For both types of groups, votes will be possible such as Majority rules,
2/3rds, 3/4ths, 9/10ths, Unanimous, etc.
    In the case of appointed members (2), permissions can be granted to members,
such as dictator, dictator subject to veto,
    veto power, etc etc. In this way, democracies, republics, corporations, etc
all become possible through simple config changes.

    But all of the actual voting will not happen until I code classes like
OTBallot, OTElection, etc. That's not my current
    focus. We will get to that in time. Rather, my focus is on the use of
SHAREHOLDERS to allow weighted, account-based ownership
    of STOCK in ENTITIES.  My interest right now is on the ENTITIES THEMSELVES,
and their ability to be party to agreements, and
    to hire employees, and to own property and asset accounts.

    So an EntityID is similar to a TitleID, in the sense that an entity is a
piece of property that can be owned. But an EntityID
    is also similar to an InstrumentDefinitionID, since there can be a currency
issued for
that entity. And an entity is also similar to a smart
    contract, in the sense that it can have bylaws, and it can have "parties to
the agreement".

    Beyond that, entities will also have the ability to hire employees, sign
contracts, own property, etc. Distribute funds up and
    down the hierarchy, and have access the communications and receipts up and
down the hierarchy.

 -- Entity will not be derived from a Title, because they are fundamentally
different enough. Entities are owned by the voting groups
    that make them up, according to their laws. Whereas Titles are owned based
on holder of Deed.

 -- Therefore, NOT needed for now: OTTitle, OTDeed, OTBallot, OTElection.

 -- NEEDED and coming soon: OTVotingGroup, OTEntity.  I'll start on these once I
have proven the first SMART CONTRACT (Escrow!!!!!)


===> NEW THOUGHT:  I think OTUnitDefinition should be derived from OTScriptable
instead of Contract. There's no reason why an
     issuer shouldn't be able to attach scripts to certain aspects of a
currency, right? Hooks could trigger at various currency-related
     events.  There's also no reason why an issued currency shouldn't be able to
have parties. But who are the parties, if not the issuer?
     In the case of OTUnitDefinition, the parties will be whoever are configured
to do whatever the clauses need them to do, which will often
     be nothing, though technically they could be used for AUTOMATED BAILMENT
PROCESSES!! (Say one of the parties is a voting group consisting
     of anyone who holds stock. And that party has the right to trigger the
"bailout" clause, which has the power the transfer the funds auto-
     matically (via a script) to another party or account.)  I don't know how
people might use this, but it seems potentially useful.

 ===> Once this is in place, then it's easy to have OTEntity be derived from
OTUnitDefinition!!  And that's where we'll get our Entity ID.

 ===> ANOTHER IDEA:  SHould be easy to move funds ONTO THE SMART CONTRACT
ITSELF. Just have an XML tag where stored funds go, perhaps with the
      funds double in a server backing account (similar to how the cash already
is.)  The script can enable peeps to move funds from an acct
      and to a safe place (inside the smart contract itself) until some other
rule causes it to be moved somewhere else. This is needed for ESCROW!!!
      Perhaps I'll call this a "fund".  OTFund.  The only other way for an
entity to control funds is to open accounts, meaning it must trust the
      Nym who's been appointed to the role of managing that account. The entity
ITSELF can't open accounts because there is no signer!!! But the
      entity CAN control FUNDS, because they are stored inside the entity
itself!! (relevant parties get receipts for changes to entities...) And
      unlike a Nym, everyone can trust a cold, hard, script.


 ===> REALIZATION:  For my audit protocol, I wanted to have some kind of DHT to
store the receipts, where issuer and customer both have access to
      them, but where the system itself cannot otherwise be shut down. And you
can't just put some IP address of a server into the contract (as the
      location for those receipts) because then a "power that be" can read the
contract, and shut down the server at that IP.
        BUT NOW, possibly the solution may somehow lie in Namecoin, which is a
censorship-proof DHT where I could store an I2P address. Do I still need
      a DHT for the receipts themselves, as long as DNS is safe from
interference, and I can control where it points to? Since all parties (issuer
and
      users) would read their receipts from the same place (whichever address is
listed in Namecoin) and since it's on an anonymous network, then I
      believe the issuer and transaction server can exchange receipts in a safe
way. Possibly this solves any auditing issues, though I still need to
      devise the protocol.
      But this still means that someone is running a server somewhere, and must
be in order for people to get their receipts, whereas using a full DHT
      solution is more... certifiable. notarizable. Because you have the whole
blockchain verifying that receipt was posted...

        Maybe the issuer just needs to demand that all receipts are numbered
sequentially? hm.

 ===> NEW THOUGHT: For Auditing protocol:  EVERY RECEIPT for any specific asset
type should be sequentially numbered, AND should contain the hash of
      the receipt that came before it.  This way, the auditor can receive a
verifiable stream of receipts, which can also be queried by transaction #,
      which is unique to all transactions on the transaction server, as well as
queried by sequence number, which is unique to the issuer, as well as
      queried by hash value, which is used to prove sequence.
      Every receipt should be encrypted to a random key, and then that key
should be encrypted to three recipients: the server, the auditor, and the
      party doing the transaction. The receipts should otherwise be publicly
available (though encrypted) and auditors and parties should have to retrieve
      them from the same place.  Even if I allow the parties to keep the
receipts directly in response to their server messages, they can still compare
      notes directly with the auditor and each other on the hashes for the
various sequence numbers. Hm.

// OTScriptable isn't derived
// from OTCronItem, so it can't do those things, therefore it can't be allowed

//
// Fair enough. But then, why not put move_funds into OTCronItem? After all, it
// IS derived from
// OTScriptable, if you go far enough back, and so it technically can play both
// sides. Here's why not:
// Because OTTrade and OTPaymentPlan were both written before I wrote all the
// smart contract stuff.
// It was only when I added smart contracts that I finally implemented Parties,
// Agents, Bylaws, Clauses,
// etc etc. This means that the way things are done is vastly different.
// Therefore while OTSmartContract
// is derived from OTCronItem, OTSmartContract is the first Cron Item that does
// it the SCRIPTABLE way,
// whereas OTTrade and OTPaymentPlan still do it the "OTCronItem" way.
//
// For example, in OTSmartContract, the Opening Transaction # is stored ONE FOR
// EACH PARTY, and the
// Closing Transaction # is stored ONE FOR EACH ASSET ACCOUNT.  You can have
// many many parties AND
// asset accounts on a smart contract.  This is simply not the case for OTTrade
// and OTPaymentPlan. They
// use their own little built-in system for managing their strict system for
// storing the exact numbers
// they need. They always use the exact same number of Nyms and accounts.
//
// But smart contracts obviously do much more, so a more elegant system has been
// crafted into OTSmartContract
// which blends the best qualities of OTScriptable AND OTCronItem, and which is
// the only place where you can
// have BOTH script interpretation (from OTScriptable) AND money-moving,
// receipts, transactions, etc (OTCronItem).
//
// Therefore, OTCronItem already has the lower-level call to MoveFunds, which
// you can see commented below.
// And OTSmartContract will have a higher-level version that can be available
// inside scripts as an "OT Native call",
// and which searches the parties/accounts/agents etc so that it is able to then
// make the lower-level call.
// Therefore move_funds goes in OTSmartContract, and MoveFunds goes in
// OTCronItem.

CALLBACKS

DONE party_may_cancel_contract(party_name)                (See if a party is
allowed to cancel the contract from processing.)
DONE party_may_execute_clause(party_name, clause_name)    (See if a party is
allowed to execute any given clause.)

NATIVE CALLS

DONE move_funds(from_acct, to_acct, amount)        (from_acct and to_acct must
be a party to the agreement)
DONE stash_funds(from_acct, "stash_one", 100)    ("stash_one" is stored INSIDE
the smartcontract! Server-side only.)
DONE unstash_funds(to_acct, "stash_one", 100)    (Smartcontract must be
activated with NO stashes. Server creates/maintains stashes AFTER activation.)

DONE get_acct_balance(acct)                        Returns std::int64_t. (Named
acct must be party to agreement with legitimate authorized agent.)
DONE get_acct_instrument_definition_id(acct)                Returns std::string.
(Named
acct must be party to agreement with legitimate authorized agent.)
DONE get_stash_balance(stash, instrument_definition_id)    Returns std::int64_t.
(Named
stash must exist.)

DONE send_notice(to_party)        (Like sendMessage, except it comes from the
server, not another user. Drops current state of smart contract to Nymbox of all
agents for party named.)
DONE send_notice_to_parties()    (Does a send_notice to ALL parties.)

DONE deactivate_contract()        (Deactivates and finalizes the smart
contract.)

HOOKS

DONE cron_process        (Triggers every time the smart contract "processes" on
cron.)
DONE cron_activate        (Triggers when the smart contract is first activated.)

    // Nym--whether that Nym is representing

    // A party might have many agents who are only voting groups, and cannot
    // actually sign for things
    // the way that nyms can. But at least ONE of those agents IS a Nym --
    // because there must have been
    // an authorizing agent who initially signed to accept the agreement, and
    // who fronted the opening
    // transaction number that activated it.
    //
    // Similarly, the authorized agent for any given party's account (each
    // account has its own authorized
    // agent) MUST be an active agent (an active agent is one with a
    // Nym--whether that Nym is representing
    // himself as the party, or whether representing some entity as an employee
    // in a role). Why MUST the
    // authorized agent be an active agent? Because when funds are moved, that
    // Nym must be loaded since
    // the account must show that Nym as a legal owner/agent. The MoveFunds will
    // cause a paymentReceipt to
    // drop into the Inbox for the relevant asset accounts, and that
    // paymentReceipt can ONLY be accepted
    // by that same Nym, who must use a transaction # that he signed for
    // previously and received through
    // his nymbox. There is actually no justification at all to take funds from
    // that account, since the
    // new balance has not yet been signed, UNLESS THE PAYMENTRECEIPT CONTAINS A
    // VALID, SIGNED AUTHORIZATION
    // FROM THE ACCOUNT HOLDER. *That* is why the authorizing agent must either
    // be the Party's Owner himself
    // (representing himself as an agent, which most will do) in which case he
    // will appear as the valid
    // owner of the account, OR he MUST be a Nym working in a Valid Role for an
    // Entity, where said Entity is
    // the valid owner on the account in question. Either OT, it will be
    // possible in OT for him to sign for
    // the paymentReceipts when they come in, and impossible for him to escape
    // liability for them.
    // (That's the idea anyway.)
    //
    // Since we know that the Authorized Agent for an account must be an ACTIVE
    // agent (one way or the other)
    // then we can error out here if he's not.  We can then pass in his Nym ID

//    (Parties to trades and payments each have their own opening numbers.
// Therefore you can with scripts. But only one can activate.)
//    With trades, each Nym has their own cron item and #. With payment plans,
// there is only one cron item, and the sender is the
//    activator. Since he is the one paying, the number used is his. The other
// guy still gets receipts, but the code is smart
//    enough to create his receipts using HIS opening number, which he still has
// to provide up front. (Hmm.. in implementation that's not true...)
// Anyway, continuing: But those receipts contain
//    COPIES of the original cron item that was ACTIVATED by the sender, and has
// his trans# on it.
//    Still: the cron item is saved to storage under a specific number, right?
// Scripts must be smart enough to drop a receipt for
//    each party where the Opening Number comes from THAT PARTY, and where a
// closing number comes from one of his accts.
//
// 2) Verify this details against ALL parties copies.
//
// 3) If an optional list of Nyms is passed in, then verify all their signatures
// as well. hmm.
//
// May not even need this function. Could be the new ones above are enough to
// cover it all.
//

// ABOVE Makes sure that all parties' signed copies are equivalent to my own
// (*this)
//
// Once this is established, then BELOW verifies all the data on (*this) against
// the actual Nyms passed in.
//
// Finally, the signature for each is verified against his own copy.
//

// For smart contract:
//
// 1) Assume verifier could be any one of the parties, not necessarily the
// originator

// TO WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING CRON SYSTEM, the originator's Opening and Closing
// #s must be set
// and available onto THIS CRON ITEM, so that GetTransactionNum() is the opening
// and GetCountClosingNUmbers()
// contains at least 1 number. Thus: if originator does not have an asset
// account in his party, we fail to activate!!
// Originator MUST have an asset account...
// Why? Who cares about the closing numbers except for custom code for specific
// things like trades? We only REALLY
// care about the closing number when we need to put it into an asset account's
// inbox as a finalReceipt. AHHH But
// the server DOES drop copies of all finalReceipts into your NYMBOX as well, as
// a NOTICE, so you can get the news faster.
// And the SAME NUMBER is put onto that receipt, which you receive in your
// Nymbox even if you HAVE NO asset account.
// Perhaps you should provide one for your Nym AND for all your accounts.  That
// way your Nym can get a copy of all those
// notices, but even without any asset accounts, he STILL gets a notice
// onFinalReceipt with his own special number on it.
//
// THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS:  With inbox finalReceipts, the closing number stays
// open until you process your inbox to accept it.
// You receive a notice of that same receipt in your Nymbox already, so that you
// know to stop using your OPENING number. This is
// because it's possible for it to appear out of the blue, and your transactions
// for all accts would stop working unless you knew
// which inbox to examine for the finalReceipt that must have appeared. So it
// goes into Nymbox so you only have to check one place.
// WHEREAS WITH SMART CONTRACT NYMBOX NOTICES, the Nymbox notice can also
// contain a CLOSING # for that NYM ITSELF. So it sees
// when the script has ended. HMM.  Why not have the Nym's Opening # be verified
// to start, and then that SAME # go into the Nym's
// Nymbox on the finalReceipt? The Nym can then close it out on his side (thanks
// to that notice) the same as it does now with other cron items.
// The "closing #" that would also be on the nymbox notice is unneeded in this
// case, since there are no asset accounts, and the Nym just needed
// notice that his opening number was free again.
//
// Therefore, to work within existing cron system, it should be easy to simply
// add the Opening Number for originator, AND
// to set the Closing Number on the Cron Item to be the originator's opening
// number, in cases where he has no asset accounts.
// I'm curious where that may ever even be needed -- I bet it's only there to
// provide a common location, since the other cron item
// types all happen to use it. I will endeavor to work within a paradigm where
// closing numbers are only needed for asset accounts
// and where Cron Items are still functional without them, for Nyms using
// contracts without asset accounts.
//
// UPDATE: in actual implementation, I resolved this with the simple requirement
// that the Nym who ACTIVATES a
// smart contract, must be the authorized agent for at least ONE account for his
// party, in that contract!  This
// simple requirement, which would probably be true anyway, in practice, insures
// that there are legitimate opening
// and closing transaction numbers available from the Nym who actually activates
// the contract.
// (That Nym, however, is still subject to the rules of the contract.)

// Here are my notes of what is needed here:
//
//    return true; // Success!
//}
//

// Old thoughts
// Note: agents will have restrictable permissions. Should be overridable in the
// role,
// in the agent itself (in the party), etc. Like a registered agent -- he can
// ONLY activate
// things (and sign for them...) After that, the passive mechanism of the group
// voting takes
// over for all future meetings/decisions.
// But someone must sign at first.  This can be a "registered agent" if you
// want, with limited
// authority, only allowed to activate.

// theNym is trying to activate the smart contract, and has
// supplied transaction numbers and a user/acct ID. ==> theNym definitely IS the
// owner of the account... that is
// verified in Server::NotarizeTransaction(), before it even knows what KIND
// of transaction it is processing!
// (For all transactions.) So by the time Server::NotarizeSmartContract() is
// called, we know that much.
//
// But for all other parties, we do not know this, so we still need to loop them
// all, etc to verify this crap,
// at least once. (And then maybe I can lessen some of the double-checking, for
// optimization purposes, once
// we've run this gamut.)
//
// One thing we still do not know, until VerifySmartContract is called, is
// whether theNym really IS a valid
// agent for this contract, and whether all the other agents are valid, and
// whether the accounts are validly
// owned by the agents they list, and whether the authorizing agent for each
// party has signed their own copy,
// and whether the authorizing agent for each party provided a valid opening
// number--which must be recorded
// as consumed--and whether the authorized agent for each account provided a
// valid closing number, which likewise
// must be recorded. (Set bBurnTransNo to true if you want to enforce the stuff
// about the opening and closing #s)

    // well as

    //
    bool bAreAnyInvalidAccounts = false;

    /*
     NOTE on syncronicity...

     Above, we burned all the opening numbers for ALL the various nyms, even if
     there was some failure halfway through
     the verification process. This in order to make it easy to tell whether,
     for you, that number is still good or not.

     Similarly, what about the closing numbers (below) ? They are not instantly
     BURNED just for the ATTEMPT (as the
     opening numbers were) but they are still marked below as "USED BUT STILL
     ISSUED."

     if (bAreAnyInvalidParties) just above insures that the below code will not
     run if there are any invalid parties.
     That means that if "the message succeeded but transaction failed" due to
     invalid parties, then the closing numbers
     will never be seen by the server and thus never marked as "USED BUT STILL
     ISSUED." Instead, they would still be
     considered "ISSUED AND AVAILABLE."

     Based on that:
     If some FAILURE occurs below, as above, it still completes the loop in
     order to have consistent results for the
     closing transaction numbers, for all parties. So we know that success or
     fail, if the below code runs, the closing
     number is DEFINITELY marked as "USED BUT STILL ISSUED" for ALL parties,
     whereas if the below code does not run, the
     closing number for all parties is definitely still marked as "ISSUED AND
     AVAILABLE" (as far as this message is
     concerned.)

     Thus, there is still an inconsistency. When a client is later trying to
     interpret which transaction numbers to "claw
     back", he will have to harvest back the closing numbers SOMETIMES, based on
     WHY the transaction failed verification,
     and thus he cannot rely on a "transaction failed" state to give him a
     reliable answer to that question.

     However, we must keep in mind that these CLOSING numbers have NOT been
     burned -- they ARE still on the client's local
     list for his nym as "USED BUT STILL ISSUED." If the client harvests them
     back each time consistently, what will happen?
     The client will look at each closing number, see if it's on his local
     "issued" list (which it is) and then will re-add
     it to his "available" list as well. So is it really available on the server
     side? The answer is: sometimes.

     SOLUTION?
     1. Above, cache a list of all the parties who failed verification.
     2. Allow the code below to run, even if some parties have failed.
     3. Change the code below to skip failed parties while verifying accounts.
     (Using afore-mentioned list to make this possible.)
     4. Move the "if failed parties, return false" block BELOW this loop, in
     conjunction with the invalid accounts block.

     This will guarantee that closing numbers are consistently marked as "USED
     BUT STILL ISSUED" on the server side, no matter
     HOW the transaction has failed. (At least it will then be consistent.)

     However, if the transaction HAS failed, then all those closing numbers, if
     the clients are to claw them back, must be
     marked as available once again on the server side, as well! And if the
     clients are NOT to claw them back for future use,
     then how will they ever close them out? The server already won't allow the
     numbers to be used again, since they were
     marked as "used but still issued". But the transaction is ALREADY closed
     (it failed.)

     SOLUTIONS?
     -- Server could burn the closing numbers for failed transactions, vs
     marking them as "used but issued" when the transaction
        is successful. That way any client getting notice of the failure would
     DEFINITELY know that those numbers were burned, and
        could sync himself accordingly. (We definitely need to notice all
     parties as well, in this case, since they will need
        to discard the burned numbers after that point, in order to avoid going
     out-of-sync.)

     -- Server could also, in the event of transaction failure, mark the closing
     numbers as "available again, like new!"
        This way clients could clearly determine whether to burn their numbers
     or mark them as available again, purely based
        on the transaction's failure state. (State meaning the message itself is
     successful, and transaction could be success or fail.)
        Clients will not go out of sync in this case, if they fail to adjust to
     match the server. Well, they would be out of
        sync, but not the kind that prevents you from doing new transactions.
     (Rather, it's the kind where you have certain numbers
        signed out forever and you can never get rid of them.) Therefore, a
     notice is ALSO needed for this case.

     -- I know notices are already being sent upon activation, but I need to
     research that more closely now and determine the
        exact circumstances of these notices. Clearly a notice is REQUIRED, no
     matter which above option I choose!

     Thought: If notice is REQUIRED either way, perhaps the clients can just
     assume X unless a notice is received? For example,
     a client could just ASSUME the closing number is "used but still issued"
     unless notice is received to the contrary. This IS
     how the state would be if the transaction were successful, yet if it had
     failed, or hadn't been activated yet, the client
     also wouldn't experience any syncing issues by making this assumption.

     Clearly the server HAS to, in the event of transaction failure, mark the
     closing numbers either as "available again, like new!"
     or it has to mark them as BURNED, but either way, it's an additional piece
     the server has to do (up until now it has only
     marked them as "used but still issued.") What I can see is the server HAS
     to do something about those numbers, and it HAS
     to notify all the parties whether that transaction succeeded or failed, and
     then those parties HAVE to fix their client-side
     transaction count BASED on whether that transaciton succeeded or failed.

     Therefore:

     1. Implement the above 4-step solution.
     2. Do something about all the closing numbers, if activation fails.
        (Keep the nyms loaded until that is done, so as not to have to load them
     twice.)
     3. Make sure the parties are consistently noticed either way.
     4. Make sure the parties are syncing their numbers properly based on these
     notices.


     WOW, eh?  But I believe that smart contracts are the most complicated case,
     so this has got to be the worst of it, now handled :-)

     Another note: If we assume the server burns the closing numbers, then the
     clients will suddenly be out-of-sync and unable
     to process transactions until they receive and process the notice of this
     failure. But if we instead assume that the server
     "makes new" those closing numbers, then the clients will remain in sync
     regardless of notice, and they only need to harvest
     the numbers upon notice, just so they can use them again, and they will not
     experience any "out of sync failures" along the
     way. Thus, it is preferable for the server to "make those numbers new
     again!" in the event of activation failure, AND to notice
     the parties of this so that they can do likewise.
     One way to notice them is to drop the "message succeeded but transaction
     failed" server reply into ALL of their Nymboxes,
     and not just the activator's. But not sure if that's safe... hm.

    // the original

    // does, by default.)

    // merely be an agent
    // for a party, (legitimately) but where a DIFFERENT agent is the one who
    // originally signed.
    // Thus, I have to allow SmartContract to override the method so it can add
    // that extra intelligence.
    //
    // NOTE: This function does NOT verify that the Nyms are authorized for the
    // ASSET ACCOUNTS--either the
    // party providing authorization OR the acct itself. Instead, this ONLY
    // verifies that they are actually
    // agents for legitimate parties to this agreement ACCORDING TO THOSE
    // PARTIES, (regardless of the asset
    // accounts) and that said agreement has also been signed by authorized
    // agents of those parties.
    // (Usually the agent who originally signed, and the agent signing now, and
    // the
    // party that agent represents, are all in reality the SAME NYM. But in the
    // case of
    // smart contracts, they can be different Nyms, which is why we now have an
    // overridable virtual method
    // for this, instead of simply verifying both signatures on the cron item
    // itself, as the default
    // OTTrade and OTAgreement versions of that virtual method will continue to
    // do.
    //
    // Repeat: this is not about verifying account ownershp or permissions. It's
    // ONLY about verifying
    // that these nyms are actually authorized to act as parties to the
    // agreement. Verifying their ownership
    // rights over the asset accounts is done separately below.
    //
    // Another thing: The original "VerifySignature()" proved that the NYM
    // HIMSELF had signed/authorized,
    // whereas now it's more like, prove which party owns the account, then
    // prove that party has authorized
    // Nym as his agent.
    //

    // VerifyNymAsAgent() replaces VerifySignature() here. It's polymorphic, so
    // VerifySignature() is still called
    // directly on theNym in certain versions (agreement, trade...) but
    // otherwise there is now more to it than that.
    // See OTScriptable for the complicated version. Either way, it makes sure
    // that the right person signed and that
    // theNym is authorized to act by that person. (As far as pOrigCronItem
    // cares -- the Account may still disagree.)
    // This verifies:
    // - that the Nym is found as an agent on one of the parties.
    // - that there is an "original party signed copy" of the contract attached
    // to the party.
    // - that there is an authorizing agent for that party whose SIGNATURE
