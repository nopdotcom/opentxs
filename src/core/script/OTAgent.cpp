// A Nym cannot act as "agent" for another Nym.

//
// An entity is COMPOSED of its voting groups and its employee Nyms.
// These don't merely act "on behalf" of the entity, but in fact they comprise
// the entity.
// Therefore the entity can use voting groups and employee Nyms to make
// decisions BECAUSE
// IT **HAS** voting groups and employee nyms that it can use.
//
// Whereas an individual Nym is NOT composed of voting groups or employee Nyms.
// So how could
// he designate to act "on his behalf" something that does not even exist?
// So we must ask, how can another Nym, then, be appointed to act as my agent
// without some
// agreement designating him as such? And that agreement is the entity itself,
// which is nothing
// more than an agreement between several owners to designate agents to operate
// according to their
// interests.

// To directly appoint one Nym to act on behalf of another, yet WITHOUT any
// agreement in place,
// is to behave as one is the same as the other. But still, who has the key? If
// both have absolutely
// access and rights to the same key, then why not just both keep a copy of it?
// In which case now
// it really IS only one Nym in reality, as well as in the software.
// But if one prefers to have his private key, and another his, then they will
// begin as separate and
// independent individuals. One Nym will not be found within the other as a
// std::int64_t-lost, under-developed
// twin!
// Just as reality enforces separate individuals, so does the software end up in
// the situation where
// two separate Nyms now wish to act with one as agent for the other. This wish
// is perfectly valid and
// can be accommodated, but logically the software cannot provide the same
// ONENESS of ACTUALLY SHARING
// THE PRIVATE KEY IN REAL LIFE (which allows the software to ACTUALLY only deal
// with a single key),
// as opposed to the oneness of "we have separate keys but we want to act in
// this way". There is oneness,
// and then there is oneness. OT is about contracts between Nyms, and therefore
// that is the mechanism
// for implementing ANY OTHER FORM OF AGENCY. Whether that agent is your "best
// man" or a board of voters,
// and whether the agent acts on behalf of you, or some corporation or
// democracy, either way, either his
// key is the same bits as your key, or they are separate keys in which case
// there is an agreement
// between them. Otherwise OT simply does not know which agents have
// authority--and which do not. This
// knowledge is necessary just for being able to function, and is imposed by the
