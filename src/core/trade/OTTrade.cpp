    // Item member.
    //
    // Unfortunately, marketReceipt doesn't adhere to this convention, as it
    // stores the Updated Cron Item (the trade) in
    // the note instead of the attachment, and it stores the updated Offer (the
    // additional info) in the attachment instead
    // of the note.
